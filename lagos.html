      <li>In 2016, Lagos unveiled the Urban Transport Project, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by making their vehicles eco-friendly. Lagos plans to use natural gas as fuel for its public transport bus system (Lagos Bus Rapid Transit). Currently, road transport accounts for 50% of Nigeria's greenhouse gas emissions, so implementing natural gas to the bus service will greatly reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
