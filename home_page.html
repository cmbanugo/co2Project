     <p>There are many different ways to reduce your carbon footprint, and lessen the detrimental effects that you
        might be causing to the environment.</p>

   <p> This is a test paragraph
      Several organizations offer footprint calculators for public and corporate use,[6] and 
      several organizations have calculated carbon footprints of products.[34] The US Environmental Protection Agency 
      has addressed paper, plastic (candy wrappers), glass, cans, computers, carpet and tires. Australia has addressed 
      lumber and other building materials. Academics in Australia, Korea and the US have addressed paved roads. Companies,
      nonprofits and academics have addressed mailing letters and packages. Carnegie Mellon University has estimated the CO2
      footprints of 46 large sectors of the economy in each of eight countries. Carnegie Mellon, Sweden and the Carbon
      Trust have addressed foods at home and in restaurants.The Carbon Trust has worked with UK manufacturers on foods, 
      shirts and detergents, introducing a CO2 label in March 2007. The label is intended to comply with a new British Publicly 
      Available Specification (i.e. not a standard), PAS 2050,[35] and is being actively piloted by The Carbon Trust and various 
      industrial partners.[36] As of August 2012 The Carbon Trust state they have measured 27,000 
      certifiable product carbon footprints.[37]Evaluating the package of some products is key to figuring out the carbon footprint.[38] 
      The key way to determine a carbon footprint is to look at the materials used to make the item. For example, a juice carton is 
      made of an aseptic carton, a beer can is made of aluminum, and some water bottles either made of glass or plastic. The larger the size, 
      the larger the footprint will be.
