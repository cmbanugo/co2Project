  <p><em><b>What is a carbon footprint</em></b></p>
  <p>A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds
    emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person or group. 
    The term footprint refers to the impact that we have on the Earth. By adding the word 
    carbon to the beginning we get the phrase carbon footprint which is the amount of 
    carbon dioxide we are creating.</p>
  
<p><em>Why is my carbon footprint important</em></p>
